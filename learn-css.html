    <p id="part-1">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and
        styling of a
        document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. It is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>
    <p id="part-2"><span class="word">Key Concepts</span><br />
        Styling and Layout: CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout, colors,<br />
        fonts, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
        Structure vs. Style: HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage (headings, paragraphs, images),
        while<br />
        CSS provides the presentation and look. Think of HTML as the foundation of a house and CSS as the paint and
        decorations.<br />
        Efficiency: External stylesheets are stored in separate .css files. This saves a lot of work because you
        can<br />
        change the look of an entire website by modifying just one file.
        Syntax: CSS uses a rule-based language. Each rule consists of a selector (which HTML elements to style) and
        a<br />
        declaration block containing one or more property and value pairs (e.g., color: blue; font-size: 20px;). </p>
